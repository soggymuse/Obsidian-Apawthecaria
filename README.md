# Obsidian-Apawthecaria
Snippets and templates for setting up and playing the solo journalling RPG [Apawethecaria](https://blackwellwriter.itch.io/apawthecaria-a-poultice-pounder-adventure) in Obsidian.md.

## Flowcharts
[Apawthecaria](https://blackwellwriter.itch.io/apawthecaria-a-poultice-pounder-adventure) can be a bit confusing and involve a lot of back and forth between encounters and foraging and so on. 

**Note:** The screenshots show the flowcharts in my dark custom theme. If you copy them into your vault as .canvas files, they'll be the same colour as your theme. I plan to create light-mode versions at some point.

#### Making a Move
I made a flowchart to take you through all the different forks and decisions you need to make every time you make a move.

It's available as an [Obsidian canvas](/APAW-Process.canvas) to save directly into your vault, and as a (huge) [PNG](/APAW-Process.png) for those of you who'd prefer to be able to view it elsewhere.

**UPDATE:** (2023-01-05) I added Soaring to the Move flowchart.

#### Character Creation Flowchart
This part's not nearly as confusing, but I thought it still might come in handy to have a flowchart for it.

It's also available as an [Obsidian canvas](/APAW-Flowchart-CharacterCreation.canvas) and a [PNG](/APAW-Flowchart-CharacterCreation.png).

## Statblocks
I'm using statblocks from the [Fantasy Statblocks](https://github.com/javalent/fantasy-statblocks) plugin for things like character sheets and encounter cards.

You need a few things for these to work:
1. [Fantasy Statblocks](https://github.com/javalent/fantasy-statblocks) installed and enabled
2. The **JSON** file for whichever statblock you want to use
3. The matching **template** (.md file) for whichever statblock you want to use.

The CSS snippet(s) I'll be uploading eventually are *optional*. Mine make my statblocks match the main colours from the Apawthecaria map, but you can stick with the plugin's default or style your own.

#### Non-player Character Sheet

*With extra line for "notes"*

<img src="/APAW-NPC-Statblock.png" width="300px" />

*Without line for notes*

The NPC statblock is short and designed for quick notes about characters you meet on the road. You can get the JSON for the statblock [here](/ApawthecariaNPC.json) (to import through the Fantasy Statblock plugin) and the markdown template [here](/FSB-APAW-NPC.md) (to save in your templates folder).

#### Ailment Cards

<img src="/APAW-AilmentCard.png" width="300px" />

This is a great way to copy the ailments from the PDF into Obsidian. You can link to tables that list [TAGs] for easier research for reagents. And you could have a rollable table that links to all the ailment cards in your vault so you can go right to the ailment when you come across a patient who's suffering from it.

The JSON for the statblock is [here](/ApawthecariaAilment.json) (to import through the Fantasy Statblock plugin) and the markdown template is [here](/FSB/APAW-Ailment.md) (to save in your templates folder).


#### Coming Soon
I'll add more templates for them (and maybe the CSS, too) when I'm done fiddling.
