# Obsidian-Apawthecaria
Snippets and templates for setting up and playing the solo journalling RPG [Apawethecaria](https://blackwellwriter.itch.io/apawthecaria-a-poultice-pounder-adventure) in Obsidian.md.

## Flowcharts
[Apawthecaria](https://blackwellwriter.itch.io/apawthecaria-a-poultice-pounder-adventure) can be a bit confusing and involve a lot of back and forth between encounters and foraging and so on. 

#### Making a Move
I made this flowchart to take you through all the different forks and decisions you need to make every time you make a move.

_You can see a larger screenshot with better resolution [here](/APAW-Process_Screenshot.png)._

#### Coming Soon
I'll be adding a few parts to the flowchart at some point, like Character Creation and how _Soaring_ works. I'm not sure if I should add them to the **Making a Move** flowchart above, or if they should be separate files. What do you think?

## Statblocks

#### Coming Soon
I'm using statblocks from the [Fantasy Statblocks](https://github.com/javalent/fantasy-statblocks) plugin for things like character sheets and encounter cards. I'll add the templates for them (and maybe the CSS, too) when I'm done fiddling.
